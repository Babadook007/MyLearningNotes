# IMP Diagrams 

- Use activity diagrams with swimlanes to describe or specify runtime scenarios
![Use activity diagrams with swimlanes to describe or specify runtime scenarios](https://docs.arc42.org/images/06-activity-with-swimlane.png)

- [Describe the solution approaches as a table!] (https://docs.arc42.org/tips/4-2/)
  - quality goal: Whatâ€™s the top-level goal?
  - scenario: What is a or the detailed scenario for this quality goal?
  - solution approach: How does the system approach this scenario? What tactics, approaches or decisions have been taken in this direction?
  - link to details: Where are the details of this solution described? This link will either point to a concrete building block, (implementing the approach) or a section of the crosscutting concepts.
