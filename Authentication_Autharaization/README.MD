- ***Kerberos*** is used to manage credentials securely (authentication) 
    - It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.
    - Kerberos utilities have been installed to all nodes of IP, as the services (or client utils) need to authenticate continuously 
    - 
- ***LDAP*** is used for holding authoritative information about the accounts, such as what they're allowed to access (authorization)
- LDAP and Kerberos together make for a great combination.
